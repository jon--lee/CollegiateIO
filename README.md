# CollegiateIO


In order for this to work properly if you were to clone it, you must download and install mongodb (you must download homebrew to do it this way)
`$ brew install mongodb`
and create a direcotry for mongodb
`$ mkdir -p /data/db`
and then run `$ mongod` or `$ mongod --httpinterface`
The port will be at 27017 (and 28017 with the httpinterface flag) by default.
